# holiday-25-py-solo 🎄

### I am Dev Gad IRADUFASHA
A dedicated space for sharpening my Python fundamentals during the Christmas holiday. This project is a "No-AI" zone, focused on building core logic from scratch to prepare for advanced work in **FastAPI**, **Django**, and **Workforce development**.

---

## 🎯 Goal
To rebuild a rock-solid foundation in Python by following Mosh Hamedani’s principles, ensuring I am sharper and faster before transitioning back into heavy-duty backend frameworks.

## 🛠 Project Roadmap
I will be building the following projects with **pure logic** (No AI assistance):

- [ ] **Rolling Dice:** Logic & Randomization
- [ ] **Number Guessing Game:** Conditionals & Loops
- [ ] **Rock Paper Scissors:** User input & Game state
- [ ] **QR Code Generator:** External library integration
- [ ] **To-Do List:** CRUD operations in CLI
- [ ] **Password Generator:** String manipulation & Security
- [ ] **ATM Simulation:** Logical flows & State management, etc.

## 🚀 Future Focus
Once these basics are mastered and my "muscle memory" is restored, I will be moving into:
* **FastAPI** (High-performance APIs)
* **Django** (Robust Web Apps)
* **Workout** (Consistency in coding & health)

## 📜 Constraints
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Rule:** No AI-generated code.
- **Source:** Mosh Hamedani Python Course.
